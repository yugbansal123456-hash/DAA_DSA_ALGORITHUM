//Largest Product in a Series.Description: You are given a massive 1000-digit number.
// You must find the thirteen adjacent digits that have the greatest product.
//Architect's Challenge: You must treat this number as a vector<int>. Because the product of 13 digits can exceed 2^{31}-1,
// you must use long long for your product calculations to prevent overflow. This is a lesson in Numerical Stability.
